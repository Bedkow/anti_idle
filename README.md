# anti_idle v1.2
### A Python 3 anti-idle script written for fun using random stuff. It'll be possibly updated in the future.
### By Bedkow

In order to run the script install and import Python packages:
```
ctypes
time
keyboard
mouse
os
```
and create a txt file in a directory and replace the placeholder ('C:/Users/xxxxxxxxx//Error.txt') with its path.
Maximize the txt window.
